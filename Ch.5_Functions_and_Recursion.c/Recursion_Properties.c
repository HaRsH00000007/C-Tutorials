>>> PROPERTIES OF RECURSION :

(a.) Anything that can be done with iteration, can be done with recursion and Vice-versa.

(b.) Recursion can sometimes give the most simple solution.

(c.) "Base Case" is the condition which stops recursion.

(d.) Iteration has " infinite loop " & Recursion has " stack overflow " 
                                                       ( stack overflow means memory is full now and programme will crash just like Infinite Loop.)
